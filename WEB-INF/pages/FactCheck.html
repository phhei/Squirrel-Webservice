              <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This PG is composed of 3 parts which will be meshed together depending on the composition of the PG.</p><ol><li>First, the PG will implement a crawler. In particular, focused crawlers are of central importance to gather domain-specific information from the Web to feed domain-specific applications including domain-specific search engines, digital assistant and education platforms. With the emergence of the Semantic Web as a supplementary layer of the Web comes the need to develop hybrid focused crawlers, which can gather domain-specific information from both the Document Web and the Web of Data as well as synchronize this information so as to return concise high-recall &nbsp;domain-specific corpora. In this task, the PG will devise algorithm for the classification of website, the classification of triples and the integration of text and Semantics. The crawler will be scalable and run efficiently in parallel. The data gathered will be cleaned and formatted so as to render further processing easier. The storage of provenance information is regarded as a must so as to be able to backtrack and update the corpus. See further <a href="http://github.com/aksw/squirrel">http://github.com/aksw/squirrel</a><br><br></li><li>The next phase is focused on Link Discovery. Link Discovery is one of the pillars of the Semantic Web. The core idea is to connect distributed knowledge graphs so as to create a Web of Knowledge that can be used to address complex information needs. In this PG, iterative approaches to data integration and link discovery are to be developed. These approaches must scale to the billions of entities described on the Web of Data. An important requirement for this task comes from the semantics of the links, which can be used to validate, invalidate and propagate linking results. Distributed algorithms will hence need to be developed to achieve the goal of continuously updating the links across knowledge bases. The core of the work will be carried out by extending the currently fastest link discovery framework available, LIMES (<a href="http://limes.sf.net">http://limes.sf.net</a>).<br><br></li><li>Third, the goal of a fact checking algorithm is to validate or invalidate statements by finding confirming sources for it on the Web. Typical fact checking algorithms take statements such as "Jamaica Inn was directed by Alfred Hitchcock" as input. They return a value between -1 (definitely false) and &nbsp;1 (definitely true) by gathering information from the Web of Documents. In this PG, we will go beyond the state of the art and rely both on the Document Web and the Linked Data Web to gather evidence (including their provenance) for facts being true or false. The evidence will be combined using scalable machine learning algorithms to provide the user with time-efficient fact checking possibilities. We will focus on providing a justification for the results returned by our approach and develop interfaces (REST, natural-language, etc.) to the core algorithm.</li></ol><p>The required skills include good knowledge of the Java programming language and the willingness to delve into exciting research. The development will be carried out using Git in a Scrum-like setting. The developers of LIMES will support the team and provide them with &nbsp;the opportunity to impact the whole of the Semantic Web community. Furthermore, we will offer a strong supervision based on the development work already invested into the DeFacto framework (<a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/DeFacto">http://aksw.org/Projects/DeFacto</a>).<br> </p><div class="table-container"><table summary="m" class="contenttable"><tbody><tr><td>Contact</td><td>Prof. Dr. Axel Ngonga, Dr. Mohamed Sherif, Dr. Ricardo Usbeck, Michael RÃ¶der</td></tr><tr><td>Group</td><td>Data Science</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1">More information</td><td rowspan="1"><a href="http://cs.uni-paderborn.de/ds/teaching/thesis-and-projects/project-groups/">Website</a></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1">Open for Computer Engineering</td><td rowspan="1">no</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
